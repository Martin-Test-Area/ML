# Introduction to Machine Learning: MNIST written character classification
1.1 

We can use machine learning to help solve many different types of problems. One problem machine learning can be useful in solving is the classification problem. This is the problem of identifying which set of categories a new observation belongs to. This has many useful applications in the real world such as classifying emails as either spam, or not spam. 



1.2 

In order to classify new observations you need to use a supervised learning algorithm. This is where we use a training dataset to learn the relationship between the variables and our label before applying this relationship (algorithm) to the new observations. When we're creating our supervised learning algorithm we split our dataset up into a training dataset and a test dataset. We seperate the data then we have one dataset to train/build our algorithm and another so we can test our model. It is important that we don't train our model on test data becuase this will cause bias in our testing and will artifially increase the accuracy of our test. It is also good practice to make sure that the training dataset covers the edges of each dimension, this improves our model as we aren't extrapolating outside of our known model domain. In practise we would normally split our data up into 70% training and 30% test data. This is to ensure we have a large dataset to train our model and still have a sufficient amount data left to test our model. 

1.3 

The MNIST dataset contains information on handwritten digits from 0-9. Each digit is stored as an individual 28x28 matrix where each element is scaled between 0 and 255, where 0 indicates a blank square (no hand writing) and 255 is a filled square (hand writing). This is a useful dataset where the classification problems comes into play. Here we have 784 (28^2) variables which we can classify as one of 10 labels (0-9). The dataset is also quite large at 60,000 observations which means we can have a good sized training and test dataset which allows us to build and sufficiently test our model.
